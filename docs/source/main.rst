Welcome to Quasildr's documentation!
====================================


Quasildr is a python library for quasilinear data representation.
It mainly implements two methods, a fast quasilinear data visualization
method GraphDR and a structure extraction and inference method based on Nonparametric Ridge
Estimation.

The package is developed for single-cell omics data analysis applications,
but the method is general enough for visualization and structure extraction of
high dimensional data, so I expect it to be useful on many other data types as well.
